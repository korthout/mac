# pair - A script to add a co-authored-by line to your commit messages
#
# This script allows you to easily add a co-authored-by line to your commit messages.
# It's useful when you're pair programming or working on a commit with someone else.
# It uses fzf to allow you to select an author from the list of authors in the git history.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Save this script to your PATH, e.g. as `pair`.
# 2. Make it executable with `chmod u+x pair`.
# 3. Stage your changes with `git add`.
# 4. Run `pair` to commit your changes with a co-authored-by line.
#
# You can also add this script to your git configuration as an alias:
#   git config --global alias.pair '!pair'
# Then you can run `git pair` instead of `pair`.
#
# Note: This script requires git, sort, uniq, and fzf to be installed.
